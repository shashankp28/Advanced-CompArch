CSE240a Branch Predictor Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

1) Get a copy of the code from the class webpage

2) Make the predictor (run make in your working source directory).

3) Run the predictor
(bunzip2 -c -k ../traces/DIST-INT-1.bz2 | ./predictor)
where DIST-INT-1.bz is one of the trace files.
./predictor reads (in a binary format) from STDIN a trace
(decompressed with bzip2 on the fly). It outputs to STDOUT basic
statistics about how well the predictor did.

4) Create your own predictor.C file and predictor.h file (or modify
the existing ones).  Be sure to read the long comment at the beginning
of the provided predictor.h and follow it's directions.  Just make
sure your predictor implements the three functions exactly as their
specification reads (init_predictor, make_prediction, and
train_predictor).  The only two files of yours you will turn in are
predictor.h and predictor.C.  All other source files (and makefile)
will remain the same.

5) Submit your predictor.C and predictor.h files along with your
report (details of this specified on the webpage).  Email them to
marora@eng.ucsd.edu with subject line: "WI12 CSE240A Project 1"
